  [title]="'Optima Roslagen Hotel Website'"
  [description]="
    'This was an internship project that I did as a part of my Full Stack Education through Lexicon. Me and three other students built a fully functioning mockup hotel website for Optima Hotell Roslagen in NorrtÃ¤lje in close cooperation with our mentors and the hotel director. The project was created with a frontend made in React.js with a .NET Core backend. The website was ultimately not used by the company, but it was a great learning opportunity though, and I learned a lot about working in a team and how to collaborate effectively together using project management tools like Trello. I also got some more experience with React.js which was nice.'

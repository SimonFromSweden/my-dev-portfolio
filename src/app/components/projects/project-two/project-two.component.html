  [description]="
    'This is a project I did as a final exam project in the full stack education I was doing at Lexicon MalmÃ¶. The project was to create a fully functioning e-commerce website from scratch, with a backend and a frontend. The backend was built using C# together with Entity Framework Core while the frontend was built using standard HTML and CSS. I learned a lot about creating full stack applications in the .NET Core framework, like setting up basic CRUD-functionality in the backend and then using those functionalities to manipulate the backend from the frontend. As a customer using my app you are able to search for different products to filter which products are shown in the shop, as well as add items to cart, and purchase them. The changes are reflected in the amounts of the products in the database. The project was done entirely by myself, and I did everything from planning, designing and coding the entire application. I am very proud of the result and I learned a lot during the process. '
